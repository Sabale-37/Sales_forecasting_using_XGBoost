# Sales Forecasting with XGBoost Regressor

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a sales forecasting model using the XGBoost regressor. The goal of this project is to accurately predict future sales data based on historical sales data.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Scripts to clean and prepare the data for modeling.
- **Feature Engineering**: Techniques applied to create new features that improve model performance.
- **Model Training**: Code to train the XGBoost regressor on the prepared dataset.
- **Evaluation**: Metrics and methods used to evaluate the model's performance.
- **Prediction**: Scripts to make predictions using the trained model.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- xgboost
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn

## Installation
To set up the project environment, run the following commands:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sales-forecasting-xgboost.git
